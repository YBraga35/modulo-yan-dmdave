Scoundrels. Legends. Dumbasses. The legacy of the adventuring party Vox Machina is a complicated one. Over the course of their adventures, they've selflessly saved the lives of thousands of people in Tal'Dorei, <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-2.github.io/book.html#TDCSR,3,wildemount,0\">Wildemount</a>, <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-2.github.io/book.html#TDCSR,3,issylra,0\">Issylra</a>, and beyond. Of course, there are also countless tales of individuals they've bullied, threatened, insulted, or otherwise needlessly antagonized throughout those same adventures. These legendary figures grew from a band of dime-a-dozen sellswords in the swamp burgh of <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-2.github.io/book.html#TDCSR,3,stilben,0\">Stilben</a> to gods-blessed warriors whose actions might have saved all of Exandria from a future of undead tyranny.</p><p>The deeds of Vox Machina are sung by bards across Tal'Dorei, often exaggerating those already belief-defying tales of gods and monsters and magic. But though their legend has grown wild and unruly, the members of Vox Machina are still people. More than twenty years have passed since their last great campaign. Most of them are still alive, and the lives of these heroes have changed—in big ways and in smaller, more subtle ones.</p><p>Those among them who age have softer bodies and lines on their faces. Those among them who don't age still show the weight of the world upon their shoulders. By and large, the members of Vox Machina have set aside weapons, armor, and spells in favor of more subtle ways of helping others. Some lead the lands they were born to lead. Others have been elected to the <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-2.github.io/book.html#TDCSR,2,tal'dorei%20council,0\">Tal'Dorei Council</a>, shaping the fate of the continent's people with quiet wisdom rather than blades and battle cries.</p><p>Still, each member of this legendary band of adventurers would take up arms again in an instant if it meant protecting those they care for the most. And the @table[Vestiges of Divergence by Advancement|TDCSR|Vestiges of Divergence], whose power they unlocked in the battles against the <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-2.github.io/book.html#TDCSR,1,thordak%2c%20the%20cinder%20king,0\">Cinder King</a> and @deity[The Whispered One|Exandria|TDCSR], are still within their grasp.</p><p>The following stat blocks are here for GMs to use if their players encounter a member of Vox Machina—hopefully as an ally or a \"quest giver,\" for woe betide anyone who encounters these legendary heroes as a foe. These statistics don't represent the full extent of the characters' abilities as 20th-level adventurers, but have been streamlined to make them easier for the Game Master to run.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"2\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Pike Trickfoot</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"> <span class=\"rd__title-link \">p268</span><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable no-select no-print lst-is-exporting-image__hidden\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\" title=\"Toggle Visibility (CTRL to Toggle All)\">[–]</span></span></h3> <p>This little gnome from the <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-2.github.io/book.html#TDCSR,3,the%20bramblewood,0\">Bramblewood</a> has been called many things—dragonslayer, savior of Exandria, champion of the @deity[The Everlight|Exandria|TDCSR|Everlight], Monstah, and, more recently, Mom. But Pike doesn't care much what people call her, as long as it's said with love. Her soul befits the mantle of the @deity[The Everlight|Exandria|TDCSR|Everlight] well, as she exudes warmth, calm, and comfort. But all that cozy kindness shelters a fiery, rebellious spark that can shock strangers and inspire raucous cheers and peals of laughter from her friends.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"3\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">After the Epilogue.</span></span> <p>Pike ultimately returned @creature[Scanlan Shorthalt|TDCSR|Scanlan Shorthalt's] romantic interest after @deity[The Whispered One|Exandria|TDCSR] was defeated and Exandria saved once more. There was no denying that she loved him, and they settled down in <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-2.github.io/book.html#TDCSR,3,westruun,0\">Westruun</a> and had two children within a year of one another, Juniper and Wilhand'ildan (Juni and Wax for short). When the kids went off to school (one to seminary, the other to <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-2.github.io/book.html#TDCSR,3,2.%20westhall%20academy,0\">Westhall Academy in Westruun</a>), Pike and @creature[Scanlan Shorthalt|TDCSR|Scanlan] decided to call it quits, with sad smiles and promises to always be the best of friends. And they've since kept that promise, even as the two of them each sought new paths in life.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>Missing her found family, Pike moved to <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-2.github.io/book.html#TDCSR,3,whitestone,0\">Whitestone</a> and built a temple to the @deity[The Everlight|Exandria|TDCSR|Everlight] in the city's Temple Ward. It's beautiful, small, and cozy—a true work of art down to the smallest details. Folk can find her there most days, tending to the gardens but always ready to lend a helping hand or a prayer. Many mornings, Pike swings by the <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-2.github.io/book.html#TDCSR,3,8.%20slayer's%20cake%20bakery,0\">Slayer's Cake</a> to make sure the baked goods remain as tasty as their reputation demands. She'll grab some fresh pastries and coffee to go, and maybe drop off a delivery at Kiki's—that is, Keyleth's—house.</p><p>@creature[Scanlan Shorthalt|TDCSR|Scanlan] usually comes by <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-2.github.io/book.html#TDCSR,3,whitestone,0\">Whitestone</a> in the summer, his and Pike's favorite time of year. This is a time for simple pleasures—eating dinners with the kids and their @creature[Keyleth, Voice of the Tempest|TDCSR|Auntie Kiki], @creature[Vex'ahlia|TDCSR|Auntie Vex], @creature[Grog Strongjaw|TDCSR|Uncle Grog], and @creature[Percival de Rolo|TDCSR|Uncle Percy]; playing music by the fire; hearing Wilhand'ildan and young Vax'ildan de Rolo joke in private about their names and their weird family; and reminiscing about times past. And sometimes, Pike and @creature[Scanlan Shorthalt|TDCSR|Scanlan] even wind up in bed together, though also, sometimes not. Though Pike's path has diverged from @creature[Scanlan Shorthalt|TDCSR|Scanlan's] in one way, their lives are never truly separated—a thing that could be said of everyone in Vox Machina.</p></div></div></div>",

          "value": "<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p>When you cast this spell, you inscribe a glyph that later unleashes a magical effect. You inscribe it either on a surface (such as a table or a section of floor or wall) or within an object that can be closed (such as a book, a scroll, or a treasure chest) to conceal the glyph. The glyph can cover an area no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If the surface or object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>The glyph is nearly invisible and requires a successful Intelligence (&amp;Reference[skill=Investigation]) check against your spell save DC to be found.</p><p>You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or standing on the glyph, removing another object covering the glyph, approaching within a certain distance of the glyph, or manipulating the object on which the glyph is inscribed. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers include opening that object, approaching within a certain distance of the object, or seeing or reading the glyph. Once a glyph is triggered, this spell ends.</p><p>You can further refine the trigger so the spell activates only under certain circumstances or according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight), creature kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect aberrations or drow), or alignment. You can also set conditions for creatures that don't trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.</p><p>When you inscribe the glyph, choose explosive runes or a spell glyph.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"1\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Explosive Runes.</span></span> <p>When triggered, the glyph erupts with magical energy in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on the glyph. The sphere spreads around corners. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes [[/damage 5d8]] acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage on a failed saving throw (your choice when you create the glyph), or half as much damage on a successful one.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"2\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Spell Glyph.</span></span> <p>You can store a prepared spell of 3rd level or lower in the glyph by casting it as part of creating the glyph. The spell must target a single creature or an area. The spell being stored has no immediate effect when cast in this way. When the glyph is triggered, the stored spell is cast. If the spell has a target, it targets the creature that triggered the glyph. If the spell affects an area, the area is centered on that creature. If the spell summons hostile creatures or creates harmful objects or traps, they appear as close as possible to the intruder and attack it. If the spell requires @status[concentration], it lasts until the end of its full duration.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"1\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">At Higher Levels.</span></span> <p>When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage of an explosive runes glyph increases by [[/damage 1d8]] for each slot level above 3rd. If you create a spell glyph, you can store any spell of up to the same level as the slot you use for the glyph of warding.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div>",

The being must be known to you: a god, a primordial, a demon prince, or some other being of cosmic power. That entity sends a <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-2.github.io/bestiary.html#blankhash,flsttype:celestial=1,flstmiscellaneous:swarm=2\">celestial</a>, an <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-2.github.io/bestiary.html#blankhash,flsttype:elemental=1,flstmiscellaneous:swarm=2\">elemental</a>, or a <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-2.github.io/bestiary.html#blankhash,flsttype:fiend=1,flstmiscellaneous:swarm=2\">fiend</a> loyal to it to aid you, making the creature appear in an unoccupied space within range. If you know a specific creature's name, you can speak that name when you cast this spell to request that creature, though you might get a different creature anyway (DM's choice).</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>When the creature appears, it is under no compulsion to behave in any particular way. You can ask the creature to perform a service in exchange for payment, but it isn't obliged to do so. The requested task could range from simple (fly us across the chasm, or help us fight a battle) to complex (spy on our enemies, or protect us during our foray into the dungeon). You must be able to communicate with the creature to bargain for its services.</p><p>Payment can take a variety of forms. A celestial might require a sizable donation of gold or magic items to an allied temple, while a fiend might demand a living sacrifice or a gift of treasure. Some creatures might exchange their service for a quest undertaken by you.</p><p>As a rule of thumb, a task that can be measured in minutes requires a payment worth 100 gp per minute. A task measured in hours requires 1,000 gp per hour. And a task measured in days (up to 10 days) requires 10,000 gp per day. The DM can adjust these payments based on the circumstances under which you cast the spell. If the task is aligned with the creature's ethos, the payment might be halved or even waived. Nonhazardous tasks typically require only half the suggested payment, while especially dangerous tasks might require a greater gift. Creatures rarely accept tasks that seem suicidal.</p><p>After the creature completes the task, or when the agreed-upon duration of service expires, the creature returns to its home plane after reporting back to you, if appropriate to the task and if possible. If you are unable to agree on a price for the creature's service, the creature immediately returns to its home plane.</p><p>A creature enlisted to join your group counts as a member of it, receiving a full share of experience points awarded.</p></div>",
