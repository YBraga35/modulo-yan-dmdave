Scoundrels. Legends. Dumbasses. The legacy of the adventuring party Vox Machina is a complicated one. Over the course of their adventures, they've selflessly saved the lives of thousands of people in Tal'Dorei, <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-2.github.io/book.html#TDCSR,3,wildemount,0\">Wildemount</a>, <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-2.github.io/book.html#TDCSR,3,issylra,0\">Issylra</a>, and beyond. Of course, there are also countless tales of individuals they've bullied, threatened, insulted, or otherwise needlessly antagonized throughout those same adventures. These legendary figures grew from a band of dime-a-dozen sellswords in the swamp burgh of <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-2.github.io/book.html#TDCSR,3,stilben,0\">Stilben</a> to gods-blessed warriors whose actions might have saved all of Exandria from a future of undead tyranny.</p><p>The deeds of Vox Machina are sung by bards across Tal'Dorei, often exaggerating those already belief-defying tales of gods and monsters and magic. But though their legend has grown wild and unruly, the members of Vox Machina are still people. More than twenty years have passed since their last great campaign. Most of them are still alive, and the lives of these heroes have changed—in big ways and in smaller, more subtle ones.</p><p>Those among them who age have softer bodies and lines on their faces. Those among them who don't age still show the weight of the world upon their shoulders. By and large, the members of Vox Machina have set aside weapons, armor, and spells in favor of more subtle ways of helping others. Some lead the lands they were born to lead. Others have been elected to the <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-2.github.io/book.html#TDCSR,2,tal'dorei%20council,0\">Tal'Dorei Council</a>, shaping the fate of the continent's people with quiet wisdom rather than blades and battle cries.</p><p>Still, each member of this legendary band of adventurers would take up arms again in an instant if it meant protecting those they care for the most. And the @table[Vestiges of Divergence by Advancement|TDCSR|Vestiges of Divergence], whose power they unlocked in the battles against the <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-2.github.io/book.html#TDCSR,1,thordak%2c%20the%20cinder%20king,0\">Cinder King</a> and @deity[The Whispered One|Exandria|TDCSR], are still within their grasp.</p><p>The following stat blocks are here for GMs to use if their players encounter a member of Vox Machina—hopefully as an ally or a \"quest giver,\" for woe betide anyone who encounters these legendary heroes as a foe. These statistics don't represent the full extent of the characters' abilities as 20th-level adventurers, but have been streamlined to make them easier for the Game Master to run.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"2\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Taryon Darrington</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"> <span class=\"rd__title-link \">p272</span><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable no-select no-print lst-is-exporting-image__hidden\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\" title=\"Toggle Visibility (CTRL to Toggle All)\">[–]</span></span></h3> <p>Gleaming, resplendent, and overflowing with indefatigable confidence, Taryon Gary Darrington is every bit the man he was when he parted ways with Vox Machina over twenty years ago. These days, though, all the bravado and good cheer he had two decades ago is real—not just an act. Tary doesn't need to fake it anymore; he's made it. Even if responsibility doesn't come easily to him, he takes it whenever he has to.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"3\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">After the Epilogue.</span></span> <p>After many years running the Darrington Brigade—his heroic adventuring band—and publishing several absolutely true accounts of their exploits, Taryon realized his adventuring checklist was essentially complete. He left his home in Deastok, in <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-2.github.io/book.html#TDCSR,3,wildemount,0\">Wildemount's</a> Dwendalian Empire, and began a new chapter of his life. Leaving the brigade in the capable hands of his sister, Maryanne, and his confidant Lionel Gayheart, Taryon traveled around launching several smaller \"satellite\" brigades in <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-2.github.io/book.html#TDCSR,3,wildemount,0\">Wildemount's</a> most dangerous lands.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>Then, realizing he had spent his career as a writer of nonfiction adventure books, he decided to try his hand at fiction instead. With his trusty scribe and majordomo @creature[Doty X|TDCSR] at his side (\"Doty Ten,\" he patiently explains to anyone who mispronounces it), Taryon and his husband Lawrence moved to the Menagerie Coast, setting up in a small writing cottage in Port Damali. While Lawrence tutors local students, Taryon has been dashing off novel after novel. His most successful books are a series called \"The Deastok Mysteries,\" which feature a young, handsome blonde boy who solves crimes around <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-2.github.io/book.html#TDCSR,3,wildemount,0\">Wildemount</a> with his brilliant intellect and trusty robot sidekick.</p><p>From time to time, Taryon charters a @item[skyship|TDCSR] to visit his old friends in <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-2.github.io/book.html#TDCSR,3,whitestone,0\">Whitestone</a> and enjoy the memories of their time together as full-fledged members of Vox Machina.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"4\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">The Automatic Scribe, Doty.</span></span> <p>Doty X is much like past models of Tary's mechanical servant—vaguely humanoid but not too expressive. The new model is sleek and stylish, and not built for battle. Doty's vocabulary has grown to six words: \"Tary,\" \"Yes,\" \"Correct,\" \"Absolutely,\" \"Soon,\" and \"Handsome.\" The scribe also features a built-in shelf of Taryon's favorite books—that is, his favorite books that he's written himself—in case Taryon needs to make a sale while he's on holiday.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div></div></div>",

The gem is destroyed when the spell is cast and disappears from the helm.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">As long as it has at least one diamond, the helm emits dim light in a 30-foot radius when at least one undead is within that area. Any undead that starts its turn in that area takes [[/damage 1d6 type=radiant]] damage.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">As long as the helm has at least one ruby, you have resistance to fire damage.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">As long as the helm has at least one fire opal, you can use an action and speak a command word to cause one weapon you are holding to burst into flames. The flames emit bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. The flames are harmless to you and the weapon. When you hit with an attack using the blazing weapon, the target takes an extra [[/damage 1d6 type=fire]] damage. The flames last until you use a bonus action to speak the command word again or until you drop or stow the weapon.</li></ul><p>Roll a [[/r d20]] if you are wearing the helm and take fire damage as a result of failing a saving throw against a spell.

You can breathe underwater and gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"2\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Change Appearance.</span></span> <p>You transform your appearance. You decide what you look like, including your height, weight, facial features, sound of your voice, hair length, coloration, and distinguishing characteristics, if any. You can make yourself appear as a member of another race, though none of your statistics change. You also can't appear as a creature of a different size than you, and your basic shape stays the same; if you're bipedal, you can't use this spell to become quadrupedal, for instance. At any time for the duration of the spell, you can use your action to change your appearance in this way again.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"3\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Natural Weapons.</span></span> <p>You grow claws, fangs, spines, horns, or a different natural weapon of your choice. Your unarmed strikes deal [[/damage 1d6]] bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, as appropriate to the natural weapon you chose, and you are proficient with your unarmed strikes. Finally, the natural weapon is magic and you have a +1 bonus to the attack and damage rolls you make using it.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div></div>",
