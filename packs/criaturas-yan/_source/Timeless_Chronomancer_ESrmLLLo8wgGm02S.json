        "value": "<p>The chronomancer long ago stopped feeling the effects of the passage of time. He primarily stays within a castle his family constructed thousands of years ago. It rests on peninsula that extends out into the ocean and creates a stunning view. It also makes the castle nearly impossible to siege. From here he has watched the waves erode away the stone and reshape the land into something completely different than what it was when he was a child oh so long ago. Once in an ordinary man's lifetime he will leave and take a few years to explore the world, take note of how it has changed, and collect enough books to last him another 50 or 60 years until he feels the urge to go out and explore once again.</p><p>Despite being thousands of years old, the chronomancer appears to be in his mid-forties, this was his age he was when he unlocked the secrets of time magic. He spent every moment of his adolescence and adult life in study and performing experiments. He had a passion and his parents had incredible wealth. They were proud to be raising a scholar and a spellcaster that would shape the future of the world.</p><p>His motivations changed when his mother became sick with a disease that no cleric could seem to cure. He put her in a stasis to keep her alive until he could find a way to fix her. Afterwards, he gathered the best healers from around the world and brought them back to the castle, but when he broke the spell he realized the terrible mistake he had made. In her stasis she could feel the pain of the disease the entire time. . . he had trapped her in an inescapable prison of agony for years and her sane mind had long since faded. He would never seem to forgive himself for this and decided that he would increase his own life and continue to live on with this guilt until he has finally made peace with himself. Thousands of years later and this still has not happened.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"1\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Decider of Fate.</span></span> <p>The chronomancer has turned the tide in a few wars when he saw it fit for one side to be victorious over the other, stopping time for all but himself and with a single strike of his magical dagger putting an end to a king or general. Stories of the chronomancer and his influence are older than even the most ancient of history books. His exploits are sung about in taverns, told around campfires, and recited at dinner parties. He has written down everything he has done in his life and sometimes the events were so long ago that he gets to rediscover the memories as he reads them in his own books.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"2\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Hoarder of Knowledge.</span></span> <p>The chronomancer knows just about all there is to be known in this world, but does not spread it on his journeys. He is there merely to observe and to retain. He has forgotten more than even most elves will learn in an entire lifetime. When someone wishes to obtain knowledge of time magic from the chronomancer, he will demand they prove themselves worthy of wielding such power and engage them in combat - even if it is one against many. Few have managed to pass this test, but he will not spare them death in this combat, knowing that if they are not able to defeat him then they would not have the wisdom to use this magic and would fall victim to the same mistakes he made so many years ago.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div></div></div>",
