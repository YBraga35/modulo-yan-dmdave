Scoundrels. Legends. Dumbasses. The legacy of the adventuring party Vox Machina is a complicated one. Over the course of their adventures, they've selflessly saved the lives of thousands of people in Tal'Dorei, <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-2.github.io/book.html#TDCSR,3,wildemount,0\">Wildemount</a>, <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-2.github.io/book.html#TDCSR,3,issylra,0\">Issylra</a>, and beyond. Of course, there are also countless tales of individuals they've bullied, threatened, insulted, or otherwise needlessly antagonized throughout those same adventures. These legendary figures grew from a band of dime-a-dozen sellswords in the swamp burgh of <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-2.github.io/book.html#TDCSR,3,stilben,0\">Stilben</a> to gods-blessed warriors whose actions might have saved all of Exandria from a future of undead tyranny.</p><p>The deeds of Vox Machina are sung by bards across Tal'Dorei, often exaggerating those already belief-defying tales of gods and monsters and magic. But though their legend has grown wild and unruly, the members of Vox Machina are still people. More than twenty years have passed since their last great campaign. Most of them are still alive, and the lives of these heroes have changed—in big ways and in smaller, more subtle ones.</p><p>Those among them who age have softer bodies and lines on their faces. Those among them who don't age still show the weight of the world upon their shoulders. By and large, the members of Vox Machina have set aside weapons, armor, and spells in favor of more subtle ways of helping others. Some lead the lands they were born to lead. Others have been elected to the <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-2.github.io/book.html#TDCSR,2,tal'dorei%20council,0\">Tal'Dorei Council</a>, shaping the fate of the continent's people with quiet wisdom rather than blades and battle cries.</p><p>Still, each member of this legendary band of adventurers would take up arms again in an instant if it meant protecting those they care for the most. And the @table[Vestiges of Divergence by Advancement|TDCSR|Vestiges of Divergence], whose power they unlocked in the battles against the <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-2.github.io/book.html#TDCSR,1,thordak%2c%20the%20cinder%20king,0\">Cinder King</a> and @deity[The Whispered One|Exandria|TDCSR], are still within their grasp.</p><p>The following stat blocks are here for GMs to use if their players encounter a member of Vox Machina—hopefully as an ally or a \"quest giver,\" for woe betide anyone who encounters these legendary heroes as a foe. These statistics don't represent the full extent of the characters' abilities as 20th-level adventurers, but have been streamlined to make them easier for the Game Master to run.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"2\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Scanlan Shorthalt</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"> <span class=\"rd__title-link \">p270</span><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable no-select no-print lst-is-exporting-image__hidden\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\" title=\"Toggle Visibility (CTRL to Toggle All)\">[–]</span></span></h3> <p>Bard extraordinaire, champion of the @deity[The Knowing Mentor|Exandria|TDCSR|Knowing Mentor], and braggadocious hero of all Exandria, Scanlan Shorthalt is the kind of adventurer who will never let you forget his name. He's personally ensured that the bards spreading his legend across the world will sing his praises for decades to come.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"3\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">After the Epilogue.</span></span> <p>Scanlan has always been a self-centered, showboating braggart, but it doesn't mean he doesn't have a heart. These days, friendship and family mean more to him than anything, even if he's still not very good at showing it.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>Following the defeat of @deity[The Whispered One|Exandria|TDCSR], Scanlan eventually proposed to his long-pursued sweetheart, @creature[Pike Trickfoot|TDCSR], and they were married in a grand ceremony. The duo had a pair of children, one named Juniper (Juni) and the other named Wilhand'ildan (Wax). When the children were grown and in school, @creature[Pike Trickfoot|TDCSR|Pike] and Scanlan amicably divorced and went their separate ways, remaining good friends—and occasional lovers—but content to follow their own paths.</p><p>Scanlan is approaching a century of life, but as a long-lived gnome, his looks are much as they were in his adventuring days except for his slowly receding hairline and the slight belly he's developed. Vanity dies slowly, though, and he hides even this modest amount of aging with a comb-over, frequent use of his trademark beret, and well-placed illusion magic when he needs to look portrait perfect.</p><p>Scanlan likes to sing songs of the Vox Machina days to crowded houses in cities across Tal'Dorei. He spends his winters in <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-2.github.io/book.html#TDCSR,3,marquet,0\">Ank'Harel</a>, where he and his daughter Kaylie operate their high-end trading business, Meatman Imports &amp; Sexports. It's a good job that keeps him constantly traveling around Exandria, suiting his interest in seeking out new people and places around the world—and for new performance venues and places to get into trouble.</p><p>Also, he has a mustache now. He thinks it makes him look distinguished.</p></div></div></div>",

You can permanently eliminate all memory of the event, allow the target to recall the event with perfect clarity and exacting detail, change its memory of the details of the event, or create a memory of some other event.</p><p>You must speak to the target to describe how its memories are affected, and it must be able to understand your language for the modified memories to take root.

You can make each creature seem 1 foot shorter or taller and appear thin, fat, or in between. You can't change a target's body type, so you must choose a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you. The spell lasts for the duration, unless you use your action to dismiss it sooner.</p><p>The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to a creature's outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing or would feel the creature's head and hair. If you use this spell to appear thinner than you are, the hand of someone who reaches out to touch you would bump into you while it was seemingly still in midair.</p><p>A creature can use its action to inspect a target and make an Intelligence (&amp;Reference[skill=Investigation]) check against your spell save DC.

The entrance shimmers faintly and is 5 feet wide and 10 feet tall. You and any creature you designate when you cast the spell can enter the extradimensional dwelling as long as the portal remains open. You can open or close the portal if you are within 30 feet of it. While closed, the portal is invisible.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>Beyond the portal is a magnificent foyer with numerous chambers beyond. The atmosphere is clean, fresh, and warm.</p><p>You can create any floor plan you like, but the space can't exceed 50 cubes, each cube being 10 feet on each side. The place is furnished and decorated as you choose. It contains sufficient food to serve a nine course banquet for up to 100 people. A staff of 100 near-transparent servants attends all who enter. You decide the visual appearance of these servants and their attire. They are completely obedient to your orders. Each servant can perform any task a normal human servant could perform, but they can't attack or take any action that would directly harm another creature. Thus the servants can fetch things, clean, mend, fold clothes, light fires, serve food, pour wine, and so on. The servants can go anywhere in the mansion but can't leave it. Furnishings and other objects created by this spell dissipate into smoke if removed from the mansion. When the spell ends, any creatures or objects left inside the extradimensional space are expelled into the open spaces nearest to the entrance.</p></div>",
