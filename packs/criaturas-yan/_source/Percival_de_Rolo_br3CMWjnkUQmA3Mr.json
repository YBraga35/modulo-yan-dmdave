Scoundrels. Legends. Dumbasses. The legacy of the adventuring party Vox Machina is a complicated one. Over the course of their adventures, they've selflessly saved the lives of thousands of people in Tal'Dorei, <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-2.github.io/book.html#TDCSR,3,wildemount,0\">Wildemount</a>, <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-2.github.io/book.html#TDCSR,3,issylra,0\">Issylra</a>, and beyond. Of course, there are also countless tales of individuals they've bullied, threatened, insulted, or otherwise needlessly antagonized throughout those same adventures. These legendary figures grew from a band of dime-a-dozen sellswords in the swamp burgh of <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-2.github.io/book.html#TDCSR,3,stilben,0\">Stilben</a> to gods-blessed warriors whose actions might have saved all of Exandria from a future of undead tyranny.</p><p>The deeds of Vox Machina are sung by bards across Tal'Dorei, often exaggerating those already belief-defying tales of gods and monsters and magic. But though their legend has grown wild and unruly, the members of Vox Machina are still people. More than twenty years have passed since their last great campaign. Most of them are still alive, and the lives of these heroes have changed—in big ways and in smaller, more subtle ones.</p><p>Those among them who age have softer bodies and lines on their faces. Those among them who don't age still show the weight of the world upon their shoulders. By and large, the members of Vox Machina have set aside weapons, armor, and spells in favor of more subtle ways of helping others. Some lead the lands they were born to lead. Others have been elected to the <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-2.github.io/book.html#TDCSR,2,tal'dorei%20council,0\">Tal'Dorei Council</a>, shaping the fate of the continent's people with quiet wisdom rather than blades and battle cries.</p><p>Still, each member of this legendary band of adventurers would take up arms again in an instant if it meant protecting those they care for the most. And the @table[Vestiges of Divergence by Advancement|TDCSR|Vestiges of Divergence], whose power they unlocked in the battles against the <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-2.github.io/book.html#TDCSR,1,thordak%2c%20the%20cinder%20king,0\">Cinder King</a> and @deity[The Whispered One|Exandria|TDCSR], are still within their grasp.</p><p>The following stat blocks are here for GMs to use if their players encounter a member of Vox Machina—hopefully as an ally or a \"quest giver,\" for woe betide anyone who encounters these legendary heroes as a foe. These statistics don't represent the full extent of the characters' abilities as 20th-level adventurers, but have been streamlined to make them easier for the Game Master to run.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"2\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Percival de Rolo</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"> <span class=\"rd__title-link \">p264</span><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable no-select no-print lst-is-exporting-image__hidden\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\" title=\"Toggle Visibility (CTRL to Toggle All)\">[–]</span></span></h3> <p>Percival Fredrickstein von Musel Klossowski de Rolo III has endured much in his life. He was a young man plagued by personal demons when Vox Machina rescued him from a dismal cell in the <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-2.github.io/book.html#TDCSR,3,umbra%20hills,0\">Umbra Hills</a>. In those days, Percival de Rolo was a man driven by vengeance, with only his guns as allies, but he took no joy in that life. He has since expressed that the thing he's most grateful for is that he didn't die as the person he was, but lived long enough to grow into someone better, together with his beloved @creature[Vex'ahlia|TDCSR] and their five children.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"3\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Father and Inventor.</span></span> <p>Percival is deeply dedicated to his wife, to his children, and to the enduring health of <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-2.github.io/book.html#TDCSR,3,whitestone,0\">Whitestone</a>. The sorrows of his old life still haunt him, though, particularly the creation of firearms. But he has done his best to make peace with his past, resolving to spend the rest of his days creating things that bring joy to the lives of others rather than curtailing those lives. His crowning achievement is the <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-2.github.io/book.html#TDCSR,3,4.%20the%20heart%20of%20whitestone,0\">Heart of Whitestone</a>, a majestic clock tower that looms over his city.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"4\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">After the Epilogue.</span></span> <p>Percival largely retired from public life not long after the fall of @deity[The Whispered One|Exandria|TDCSR]. He now dedicates himself to his duties as a leader in <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-2.github.io/book.html#TDCSR,3,whitestone,0\">Whitestone</a> as much as he can, though he is more interested in creating than governing. Most of his tinkering happens in private, creating novelties such as intricate watches and streetlamps powered by volatile reactions with the acid pools beneath his city. He has also lent his knowledge to a number of feats of civic engineering, including <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-2.github.io/book.html#TDCSR,3,whitestone,0\">Whitestone's</a> skyport and <a href=\"https://5etools-mirror-2.github.io/book.html#TDCSR,3,zephrah,0\">Zephrah's</a> network of windmills.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><div class=\"float-clear\"></div><div><div class=\"rd__wrp-image relative\">\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/bestiary/TDCSR/DeRoloFluffPlaque.webp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" title=\"The de Rolo Family of Whitestone.
